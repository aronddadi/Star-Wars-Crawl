      <p class="center"> Fart 4: A new Code.</p>

  <p>
    Welcome to becode academy, this is a place for knowledge, sharing and growing. But like anything in life, becode has some bad sides to it. You WILL get addicted to coffee, you WILL have red eyes from time to time. But in the end when you weigh the good things
    against the bad things, the good ones win every time pretty convincingly. The coffee is free, you develop an actual skill, you have to walk up stairs every day, so you get a  little cardio in, from time to time there's free food. The people are friendly, inside AND outside the company.

  <p class="center"> Fart 5: The Wifi strikes again</p>
  <p>
    (get it, cuz if the wifi goes on a strike it's not working, and it goes well with the thematic of SW & beocode)(Yes I Know , explaining the joke makes the joke not funny, but then again, if the joke isn't even understood in the first place, it's even less funny)
    Now on this journey you will work, you will learn, you will enjoy, you will hate, you will suffer , you will NOT turn to the dark side, you will fart and you might take a dump.
  </p>
  <p>Yeahh</p>
